3. Summary: 
     I really like to create something, constantly learn something new and improve myself. I believe that front-end development fully corresponds to my desires and reveals all my potential. Front-end development includes coding, systematization, appearance creation (design work), etc. It will never be boring and will not be a chore. My goal is to become a full-fledged front-end developer.
